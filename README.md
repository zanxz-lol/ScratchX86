# The ScratchX86 Project
## What is ScratchX86?
ScratchX86 (formerly known as Scratch386) is an ambitious project to bring modern x86 emulation to Scratch. It has been in the works for 2 long years and has been getting better with each month!
## What can ScratchX86 do as of right now?
As of right now, ScratchX86 can load a 256KiB SeaBIOS ROM and execute it but with a few problems. It has support for a little over 70 instructions and is pretty speedy.
## What's so special about ScratchX86?
ScratchX86 isn't a port of any existing emulator (unlike the RISC-V emulator that brought Linux on Scratch and the Scratch8086 emulator that's just a complete copy-and-paste port of 8086tiny); it is 100% it's own thing, built piece by piece, by one man (me 😎🤙). Not only that, the emulator is modular! It allows other developers to add support for PMIO. For example, devs could create modules that could emulate ATA devices, serial devices, and even the QEMU's debugcon.
## Why even create this?
I created this because RISC-V and the 8086 are too limited. Not only that, it would be cool to run my own Operating Systems on an emulator that I built, and it's a great way to learn more about the x86 architecture.
# Contributions
You can contribute to this project by reporting bugs in the emulator, requesting features to be added, or by giving me some info about x86!
